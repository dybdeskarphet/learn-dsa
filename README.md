# ðŸ“š Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository is a collection of my notes, code snippets, and exercises as I work through the **[Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/?couponCode=LEADERSALE24TRFR)** on Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript. My goal is to solidify my understanding of these fundamental concepts and enhance my problem-solving skills.
